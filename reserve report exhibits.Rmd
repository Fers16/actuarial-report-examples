\begin{abstract}
The `ChainLadder` package can create some powerful loss reserving projections.  The output from these reserving functions is a comprehensive R list object with a lot of data.  The `exhibit` package extracts the most commonly desired `ChainLadder` function outputs and returns a data frame summarized by origin period.  This document displays how `exhibit` can be used along with other R packages to quickly create reports. `exhibit` also includes a function to provide default formatting.

# Required Packages and Data

```{r packages_and_options, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# CRAN packages
library(dplyr) # for manipulating data
library(ChainLadder) # reserving projections
library(pander) # make pretty tables

# Ractuary packages. Install with devtools::install_github("merlinoa/*")
library(exhibit) # default exhibits from ChainLadder package
library(casdata) # load in the data


# set pander table options
panderOptions('table.split.table', 125)
panderOptions('table.alignment.default', 'right')
```

The following examples use workers' compensation paid loss and ALAE from State Farm Mutual Group.

```{r data, results = "asis"}
# wkcomp is provided in the casdata package
state <- filter(wkcomp, GRCODE == 1767, AccidentYear + DevelopmentLag < 1999)

smry <- group_by(state, AccidentYear) %>%
  summarise(Paid = sum(CumPaidLoss_D),
            Incurred = sum(IncurLoss_D),
            Premium = unique(EarnedPremNet_D))
pander(eformat(smry))
```

`state` consists of State Farm Mutual Group workers' compensation paid and incurred losses, other information from accident years 1988 through 1997.

## Paid Loss & ALAE Triangle

```{r paid_loss_tri, results = 'asis'}
# create paid loss triangle
paid_tri <- as.triangle(state, origin = "AccidentYear", 
                        dev = "DevelopmentLag", value = "CumPaidLoss_D")

# format paid loss triangle for presentation
pander(exhibit(paid_tri, eformat = TRUE))
```

\pagebreak

## Paid Development Triangle

```{r paid_dev_tri, results = 'asis'}
# create paid development triangle
paid_ata <- ata(paid_tri)

# format paid development triangle for presentation
pander(exhibit(paid_ata, eformat = TRUE))
```

# Fitting the GLM model

Running the GLM model with default options is as easy as this:

```{r glm, results = "asis"}
# pander(exhibit(glmReserve(paid_tri)))
# alternative way to write above function.
# Helps with readability
paid_tri %>% 
  glmReserve() %>%
  exhibit(eformat = TRUE) %>%
  pander()
```

If we select to use the bootstrap method to estimate the mean squared error, the `glmReserve` function provides confidence levels.

```{r glm_boot, results = 'asis'}
glm_boot <- glmReserve(paid_tri, mse.method = "boot")
pander(exhibit(glm_boot))
```

```{r glm_cl_table, results = 'asis'}
pr <- as.data.frame(glm_boot$sims.reserve.pred)
qv <- c(0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975, 0.99)
res_q <- t(apply(pr, 2, quantile, qv))
pander(format(round(res_q), big.mark = ","))
```

Mack Chain Ladder

```{r mack, results = 'asis'}
mack <- MackChainLadder(paid_tri)
pander(exhibit(mack))
```

Bootstrap Chain Ladder

```{r boot, results = 'asis'}
boot <- BootChainLadder(paid_tri)
pander(exhibit(boot))
```
